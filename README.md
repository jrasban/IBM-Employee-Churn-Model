This project contains a logistic regression model of variables pulled from the IBM Data on Kaggle included in this repository.

This repository includes all of the preprocessed data and subsequent manipulations. 

The results show that the model is approximately 67.6% accurate (with a confidence interval of 80%) in predicting employee attrition behavior.
