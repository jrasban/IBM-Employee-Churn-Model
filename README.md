# IBM-Employee-Churn-Model
Logistic Regression Model Used to Predict Employee Attrition

This project contains a logistic regression model of variables pulled from the IBM Data on Kaggle included in this repository.

This repository includes all of the preprocessed data and subsequent manipulations. 

The results show that the model is approximately 54% accurate in predicting employee attrition behavior. Most of the inaccuracy in the
model is caused by the prediction that an employee will leave IBM but does not actually leave.
